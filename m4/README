Instructions for building OS:
  In the m4 directory:
    % make

  This will build everything from scratch and load everything into
  the floppya.img. It loads shell, tstpr2, tstprg, and messages.txt into
  floppya.img.

Instructions for testing and using the OS:
  In the m4 directory:
    % make bochs

  This should open up bochs and present you with a prompt as below:
    1F:>

  For any file stored in the directory, you can delete it by doing
    1F:> delete messag
  Then if you try to print the contents out...
    1F:> type messag
    File not found
  This is because the file name is not being tracked anymore.

  For any existing file in the directory, you can copy the contents over
  to a new file by doing
    1F:> copy messag cool
  Where 'messag' is the existing file in the directory and 'cool' is the
  new file name it will be copied into.
  Then you can print the contents as normal by doing...
    1F:> type cool
  This will now be equivalent to printing the contents of messag.

  If you want to see all of the files stored in the directory, with
  the corresponding number of sectors used, type...
    1F:> dir
    KERNEL 10
    shell 6
    tstpr2 1
    tstprg 1
    messag 1
    1F:> 

  You can create your new files in the directory by typing...
    1F:> create file
    It will allow you to enter this text.
    And when you press enter with an empty line
    it will stop asking for input and save
    your new file!

    1F:> type file
    It will allow you to enter this text.
    And when you press enter with an empty line
    it will stop asking for input and save
    your new file!

    1F:> dir
    KERNEL 10
    shell 6
    tstpr2 1
    tstprg 1
    messag 1
    file 1
    1F:> 



  If a bad command is entered, it will print an error message:
    1F:> rm -rf .
    Bad command!
    1F:>

Any bugs or deficiencies:
  None currently.

Additional features you implemented:
  The 'dir' command also prints out the size of the file represented as the
  number of sectors. Also, our shell handles silly users that don't know the
  max file name is 6 characters long. So if you type
    1F:> copy message.txt newFile.txt
  Then it will find the file 'messag' and copy it into a new file
  named 'newFil'. This is supported for all of our commands.
