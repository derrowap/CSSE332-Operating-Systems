Instructions for building OS:
  In the m3 directory:
    % make

  This will build everything from scratch and load everything into
  the floppya.img. It loads shell, tstpr2, tstprg, and messages.txt into
  floppya.img.

Instructions for testing and using the OS:
  In the m3 directory:
    % make bochs

  This should open up bochs and present you with a prompt as below:
    1F:>

  Since messages.txt is stored with an entry in the directory, if you type
    1F:> type messag
    If this message prints out, then your readSector function is working correctly!
    1F:>
  It will load the content of that file and print if for you.

  Since tstpr2 is stored with an entry in the directory, you can load
  and execute the program using the "execute" command. Below is what you
  should see:
    1F:> execute tstpr2
    If you see this message, tstpr2 is running correctly!
    1F:>
  Notice that this overwrites where the shell is stored and when tstpr2
  calles the terminate interrupt, the shell will be restarted.

  If a bad command is entered, it will print an error message:
    1F:> rm -rf .
    Bad command!
    1F:>

Any bugs or deficiencies:
  None currently.

Additional features you implemented:
