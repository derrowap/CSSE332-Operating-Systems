              Welcome to the Magic Shell!
------------------------PAGE 2--------------------------

To see some magic, try out some of the following commands in the shell:

  For any executable file in your directory, you can run them by entering
  "execute <filename>"

  To see a list of all processes, enter
  "ps"
  A table of all processes represented by their process id, current
  active status, and wait status will then be printed.

  To kill a program, enter
  "kill <process id>"
  This will terminate the process at position <process id> 
  within the process table
