              Welcome to the Magic Shell!
------------------------PAGE 1--------------------------

To see some magic, try out some of the following commands in the shell:

  For any text file in your directory, you can print the contents by entering
  "type <filename>"
  
  You can magically create your new files in the directory by entering
  "create <filename>".
  You will then be prompted to enter the magical text for the file.

  For any file stored in the directory, you can delete it by entering
  "delete <filename>"
  Then poof! Its gone!

  For any existing file in the directory, you can copy the contents over
  to a new file by entering
  "copy <source filename> <destination filename>"
