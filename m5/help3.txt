			        Welcome to the Magic Shell!
------------------------PAGE 3--------------------------

To see some magic, try out some of the following commands in the shell:

  For any executable file in your directory, you can temporarily pause
  the shell and execute said file by entering:
  "execforeground <filename>"

  To see a list of all files stored in the directory, with
  the corresponding number of sectors used, enter
  "dir"

  To make a process running at index i wait on a process at index j, run:
  "wait <i> <j>"

  If a bad command is entered, it will print an error message:
  1F:> rm -rf .
  Bad command!
