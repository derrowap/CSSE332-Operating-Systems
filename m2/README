  In this milestone, "Hello World" is printed,
  then the error message from the 0x21 interrupt handler is printed,
  then using the 0x21 interrupt, reads and prints the message.txt,
  then using the 0x21 interrupt, reads input from screen and prints it.

Any bugs or deficiencies:
  None currently.

Additional features you implemented:
  I feel like the functionality of backspaces in readString() is properly
  handled how it should be but wasn't explicity told to be like it is. If
  the backspace key is pressed when there are no more characters to remove,
  it will not print out the backspaces nor try to remove the last character
  from the buffer (since it is at the beginning of the buffer in this case).

  Other than that, just kept really clean and efficient code.
