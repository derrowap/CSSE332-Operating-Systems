1. 
Given:
	remove all binaries, including floppya.img, bootload and kernel.
When:
	run "make"
Then:
	Everything should build correctly

Common causes:
	not compiling bootload
	not zeroing floppya.img and load bootload into it.


2. 
Given:
	the program runs well
When:
	modify kernel.c a little bit, and run "make"
Then:
	only kernel is recompiled
	kernel is loaded into floppya.img

Common causes:
	kernl is not in the dependency list of floppya.img


3.
Given:
	the program runs well
When:
	remove floppya.img
Then:
	floppya.img should be rebuilt and the program should still runs

Common causes:
	The rule that generates floppya.img is not named floopya.img,
	so makefile does not recognize the changes.
